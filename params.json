{"name":"BIC","tagline":"Best IMAP Client (for Emacs)","body":"BIC is an IMAP client for Emacs.  It is built on the following\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\n* **asynchronicity**: the Emacs user interface should be blocked as\r\n  little as possible.  Any long-running commands should be run in the\r\n  background.\r\n* **minimal configuration**: you should be able to *just read\r\n  your mail* without adding half a page of configuration variable\r\n  settings to your `.emacs` file, or installing and configuring any\r\n  external programs.  *Life is too short.*\r\n* **offline is online**: the client should have the same behaviour even\r\n  if the connection to the mail server is lost, and changes should be\r\n  synchronised seamlessly once the connection is reestablished.\r\n* **osmosis**: you shouldn't have to ask your mail client to download\r\n  your messages for offline access; they should just be available\r\n  without you having to do anything.\r\n\r\nThat said, it is still a work in progress.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
