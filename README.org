* BIC, the Best IMAP Client

BIC is an IMAP client for Emacs.  It is built on the following
principles:

- *asynchronicity*: the Emacs user interface should be blocked as
  little as possible.  Any long-running commands should be run in the
  background.
- *minimal configuration*: you should be able to /just read
  your mail/ without adding half a page of configuration variable
  settings to your =.emacs= file, or installing and configuring any
  external programs.  /Life is too short./
- *offline is online*: the client should have the same behaviour even
  if the connection to the mail server is lost, and changes should be
  synchronised seamlessly once the connection is reestablished.
- *osmosis*: you shouldn't have to ask your mail client to download
  your messages for offline access; they should just be available
  without you having to do anything.

That said, it is still a work in progress.  See "Known problems"
below.

** Requirements

BIC requires *Emacs 25*, nothing less.  At the time of this writing,
Emacs 25 hasn't been released yet, so you'll need to use an Emacs
built from the development tree.  Such an Emacs will identify itself
as 25.0.50.

BIC also requires a recent version of [[http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net][jabber.el]] to be installed.  The
easiest way to satisfy this is to install the =jabber= package from
[[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].  Strictly speaking, it only requires =fsm.el= and =srv.el=,
which should probably be turned into independent libraries.

If you're using Emacs on Windows, make sure that your Emacs contains
commit d133cf8 (2015-03-27).  This commit added support for
non-blocking connections on Windows.  BIC has not been tested on
Windows, so any reports, positive or negative, are very welcome.

** How to use

Type =M-x package-install-file=, and enter the _directory_ where
bic.el etc are found.

Then type =M-x bic=.  If it's the first time you use BIC, it will ask
for your email address and IMAP server.  Otherwise, it will just start
BIC with the previously configured account.  (If you want to add
another account, type =M-x bic-add-account=.)

For any mailbox you open, BIC will download all messages that are less
than 30 days old, and all messages that are unread or flagged
regardless of date.

The key bindings are mostly based on Gnus.  See =C-h m= for the
corresponding buffer for more information.

** How to stop using it

If you just want to stay disconnected for a while, use =M-x
bic-deactivate=, and then use =M-x bic-activate= when you want to
reconnect.

If you want to stop BIC, type =M-x bic-stop= for each account you have
added.  All downloaded data is stored in the =~/.emacs.d/bic=
directory; you can remove that if you want.

** Known problems

- At the moment, it only downloads messages from your inbox
  automatically.  For other mailboxes, messages are downloaded when
  you open that mailbox.  (This does not apply if your IMAP server
  supports NOTIFY.)  You can use =M-x bic-list-status-all= to
  explicitly sync all subscribed mailboxes.
- The unread message count in the mailbox tree view is currently
  only updated when you explicity request a status update.
- It's too verbose, showing too many messages in the echo area.
- There is currently no way to access messages older than 30 days,
  unless they are unread or flagged.
- If a large number of messages has been downloaded for a certain
  mailbox, opening that mailbox will take a long time.
- It doesn't detect that messages have been deleted on the server.
- There is currently no way to copy or move messages.
- Messages are not threaded.
- There is no search function.
- If the server doesn't support =IDLE=, messages will be downloaded
  rather infrequently.
- If you enter the wrong password, BIC will repeatedly try to connect
  using the incorrect password until you run =M-x
  auth-source-forget-all-cached=.
- While BIC attempts to open connections asynchronously, Emacs
  currently performs DNS requests synchronously.  This can sometimes
  lead to the user interface being blocked while BIC tries to
  reconnect to the server.  There was
  [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg00830.html][a thread about this on emacs-devel]].

** Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, there are four places where you may want to
look for more information:

- The =*bic-transcript-username@example.com*= buffer contains a
  transcript of IMAP requests and responses exchanged with the
  server.  When copying text from the transcript buffer to another
  buffer, BIC makes an effort to remove information you might not
  want to share, such as email addresses and subject lines.
- The =*Warnings*= buffer contains warnings about unexpected events.
- The =*fsm-debug*= buffer shows messages and state transitions for
  the state machines.  This is usually uninteresting, except for the
  messages that contain "warning" or "error".
- Currently, the =*Messages*= buffer gets more than its fair share of
  various more or less informative messages.

If BIC makes Emacs slow, try profiling it to find out which part of
the code needs to be optimised:

- =M-x profiler-start=
- Do whatever makes Emacs slow.
- =M-x profiler-report=
- Afterwards, deactivate profiling with =M-x profiler-stop=.

** What about sending email?
Note that BIC is the Best IMAP Client, not the Best SMTP Client =:)=
You should look into the =smtpmail= library that is included with
Emacs.

BIC can integrate with smtpmail, to make it queue outgoing messages
while you're offline, and send them automatically when you come online
again.  To enable that behaviour, set =bic-smtpmail-toggle-queueing=
to =t=.
