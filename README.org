* BIC, the Best IMAP Client

BIC is an IMAP client for Emacs.  It is built on the following
principles:

- *asynchronicity*: the Emacs user interface should be blocked as
  little as possible.  Any long-running commands should be run in the
  background.
- *minimal configuration*: you should be able to *just read
  your mail* without adding half a page of configuration variable
  settings to your =.emacs= file, or installing and configuring any
  external programs.
- *offline is online*: the client should have the same behaviour even
  if the connection to the mail server is lost, and changes should be
  synchronised seamlessly once the connection is reestablished.
- *osmosis*: you shouldn't have to ask your mail client to download
  your messages for offline access; they should just be available
  without you having to do anything.

That said, it is still a work in progress.  See "Known problems"
below.

** Requirements

BIC requires *Emacs 24.5*, nothing less.  At the time of this writing,
Emacs 24.5 hasn't been released yet, so you'll need to use an Emacs
built from the development tree.  Such an Emacs will identify itself
as 24.4.50.

BIC also requires a recent version of [[http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net][jabber.el]] to be installed.  The
easiest way to satisfy this is to install the =jabber= package from
[[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].  Strictly speaking, it only requires =fsm.el= and =srv.el=,
which should probably be turned into independent libraries.

BIC probably doesn't work very well on Windows, because Emacs doesn't
support non-blocking connections on Windows.

** How to use

Byte-compile and load =bic-core.el= and =bic.el=, in that order.

Then type =M-x bic=.  If it's the first time you use BIC, it will ask
for your email address and IMAP server.  Otherwise, it will just start
BIC with the previously configured account.  (If you want to add
another account, type =M-x bic-add-account=.)

For any mailbox you open, BIC will download all messages that are less
than 30 days old, and all messages that are unread or flagged
regardless of date.

The key bindings are mostly based on Gnus.  See =C-h m= for the
corresponding buffer for more information.

** How to stop using it

If you just want to stay disconnected for a while, use =M-x
bic-deactivate=, and then use =M-x bic-activate= when you want to
reconnect.

If you want to stop BIC, type =M-x bic-stop= for each account you have
added.  All downloaded data is stored in the =~/.emacs.d/bic=
directory; you can remove that if you want.

** Known problems

- At the moment, it only downloads messages from your inbox
  automatically.  For other mailboxes, messages are downloaded when
  you open that mailbox.
- It's too verbose, showing too many messages in the echo area.
- There is currently no way to access messages older than 30 days,
  unless they are unread or flagged.
- It doesn't detect that messages have been deleted on the server.
- Messages are not marked forwarded when you forward them.
- There is currently no way to copy, move or delete messages.
- Messages are not threaded.
- There is no search function.
- The unread message count in the mailbox tree view is currently
  hard-coded to 42.
- If the server doesn't support =IDLE=, messages will be downloaded
  rather infrequently.
- If you enter the wrong password, BIC will repeatedly try to connect
  using the incorrect password until you run =M-x
  auth-source-forget-all-cached=.

** Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, there are four places where you may want to
look for more information:

- The =*bic-transcript-username@example.com*= buffer contains a
  transcript of IMAP requests and responses exchanged with the
  server.
- The =*Warnings*= buffer contains warnings about unexpected events.
- The =*fsm-debug*= buffer shows messages and state transitions for
  the state machines.  This is usually uninteresting, except for the
  messages that contain "warning" or "error".
- Currently, the =*Messages*= buffer gets more than its fair share of
  various more or less informative messages.
